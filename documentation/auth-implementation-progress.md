# Authentication System Implementation Progress

## Current State Analysis
We have implemented a comprehensive authentication system in `auth_routes.py` with the following endpoints:
- POST `/auth/register`: User registration with password hashing
- POST `/auth/login`: User login with JWT tokens
- POST `/auth/oauth`: OAuth login/signup
- POST `/auth/refresh-token`: Refresh access token
- POST `/auth/logout`: User logout
- POST `/auth/verify-email`: Email verification
- POST `/auth/send-verification-email`: Send verification email
- POST `/auth/forgot-password`: Password reset request
- POST `/auth/reset-password`: Reset password with token

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Backend Restructuring 
1. Created new `auth_routes.py`:
   - Moved auth endpoints from `user_routes.py`
   - Implemented `/auth/*` route pattern
   - Added all required endpoints
   - Added proper request/response models
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling

2. Created `auth_service.py`:
   - Moved auth logic from `user_service.py`
   - Implemented core authentication methods
   - Added JWT token management
   - Added password hashing with Argon2

3. Enhanced Security:
   - Implemented JWT with refresh tokens
   - Added rate limiting for auth endpoints:
     - Aggressive limits (3/min) for sensitive endpoints
     - Normal limits (10/min) for other endpoints
   - Added IP-based rate limiting
   - Added rate limit headers
   - Token blacklisting for logout (Pending Redis integration)
   - Email service integration

### Phase 2: Frontend Updates 
1. Update API Client:
   - [x] Update endpoint URLs in auth API calls
   - [x] Add new auth endpoint methods

2. Update Auth Flow:
   - [ ] Implement email verification UI
   - [ ] Add password reset flow
   - [ ] Enhance logout functionality
   - [ ] Update error handling

### Phase 3: Testing 
1. Backend Tests:
   - [ ] Unit tests for auth service
   - [ ] Integration tests for auth endpoints
   - [ ] Security tests for token handling

2. Frontend Tests:
   - [ ] Unit tests for auth API client
   - [ ] Integration tests for auth flows
   - [ ] E2E tests for complete auth process

## Next Steps
1. Integrate Redis for:
   - Token blacklisting
   - Distributed rate limiting
   - Session management

2. Implement email service:
   - Set up SMTP configuration
   - Create email templates
   - Add email verification flow
   - Add password reset emails

3. Complete frontend implementation:
   - Update API client
   - Add new UI components
   - Implement error handling

## Notes
- Basic authentication flow is working
- Rate limiting is implemented
- Password hashing is secure (Argon2)
- Need to implement token blacklisting
- Need to implement email service
- Frontend updates pending
